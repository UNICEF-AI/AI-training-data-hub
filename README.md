# repository for training samples for AI 

Why training data hub?
The field of AI has been advanced as resources for it has been enriched including computing resources, and input data such as satellite imagery, mobile phone data etc. However, not enough consideration has been given to the biases in algorithms while at cases, the consequences especially when they are used to serve humanitarian operations, which targets the most vulnerable population. One of the greatest sources of such biases is the geospatial imbalances in training samples.


What is the hub about?
We are a small research group in UNICEF. Our interest is to stimulate the advance of AI in a scalable and equitable way by addressing issues of biases in AI. As the starting point, we are working on building a hub for training data for scalable and geospatially unbiased AI. We aim at building a comprehensive database of training samples for AI starting with a focus on a few target topics. The datasets are from multiple UNICEF projects and contribution from other UN organizations such as WFP, UN secretariat etc.

How you can contribute?
All the data available in the hub are free!
You can contribute by uploading your data to the database in the matching format with the existing datasets. For an assistant or inquiries, please contact dokim@unicef.org
