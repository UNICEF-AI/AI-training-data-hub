# Repository for training data for Scalable AI 

The field of AI is making rapid progress thanks to the advances in computing technologies data generation. However, not enough consideration has been given to the biases in algorithms. One of the greatest sources of such biases is the geospatial imbalances in training samples.

This traning data hub is prepared to contribute to the advance of AI in a scalable and equitable way by addressing issues of biases in AI. As the starting point, we are working on building a repository for training data for scalable and geospatially unbiased AI. We aim at building a comprehensive database of training samples for AI starting with a focus on a few target topics. The datasets are collected from multiple UNICEF projects and contribution from other UN organizations such as WFP, UN secretariat etc.

All the data available in the hub are free!
You can contribute by uploading your data to the database in the matching format with the existing datasets. For an assistant or inquiries, please contact dokim@unicef.org
